# kotlin-hello-grpc-spring

A very simple gRPC server application sample written using Kotlin and Spring.

This server application implements the protobuf definitions from [proto-hello-grpc](https://github.com/jviniciusb/proto-hello-grpc)

# Changing Server address and port

You can change the server address and port for which the app will try to connect editing the file in [/src/main/resources/koin.properties](https://github.com/jviniciusb/android-hello-grpc-client/blob/main/app/src/main/resources/koin.properties)
